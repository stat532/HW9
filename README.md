# HW9

Recall the first three sections in the [course project](https://github.com/stat532/Project/blob/master/ProjectRubric.pdf) are introduction, data, and models.

Update your introduction and data section from the previous submission and add the model section. The introduction should contain a clearly defined research question. Include a snapshot / print out of the first few rows of your cleaned data set in the data section. Your graphics should be "publication quality" at this point. Include captions and appropriate titles and labels. Following the format from the notes on the generalized linear models, write out your sampling model, linear combination of predictors - and link function, if applicable, as well as prior specifications, for the statistical model designed to answer your research question.

This HW is worth 10 points. Turn in your developing document to D2L.
